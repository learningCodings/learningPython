Scalability And Security

HTML: 

Document Object Model-
html-> head-> title
html->body ->Hello World 

Js ability to modify Webbpages Using DOM Model

In HTML Single Elements Have No Closing Tag Beacause They Dose Not Contain Anything In Between It

CSS

attribute like declaring Class or id in CSS

margin fot add outside of of element
padding to add size inside in element

id can be used for declare unique id it can accesssed by using # It mean # mean slect only pertifvular part

class is used to use if we want to use nultiple time it can access by . 

c
  
specofocity-> inline, id, class, type 

CSS Selctorrs
a, b-> Multiple ELement
a b -> Descendant Selector
a > b -> child selector
a + b -> Ajacemt Sobling Selector
[a=b] -> Attribute Selector
a:b -> Pseudoclass Selector
a::b -> Pseudoelelement Selector


This Line Is Very Important To Make Webpage Responsive
<meta name="viewpory" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

also using @media mix and max width we can make responsove;
And Width Must Be In Accending Order

using flex and flexbox we can make webpages more responsive like in div tag 
div {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }

Alrernative for Flex is Gridview We Need To Specify Some Attributes Like coloum gap, row gap and grind coloum template Too


Boostrap Is Very Simple All I Have TO DO IS To Just Get Right Boostrap File And Class Names
To Use Boostrap Only Need TO Use CommanSense And I Know Element I'm Using And What Is Purpose Of It
And Which Code Should I Copy From Boostrap Or Which Class Should Give As Attribute To Element


Sass IN CSS

Sass Is Great It IS used to avoid repetaion of code redency of code

It Has extenion is .scss

we have to compile it to .css file using sass

it uses inheritance
in it we can declare veriables

But veriables in css make more powerful to css and its easy to use than sass and no need to do anything Extra 

Css veribales are good for me explore it more

Git: It Is A "Distrubted Version Control Tool" And I can perfom actions by using command line and also on github.com

Some Features OF Git

I can work on repository == repo, with multiple Developers

I can push code on my repo 

And I can also pull code from my repo using my repo url

And can also access my coworkers code by cloning repo in my git account

And most important I can revert my code what I changed in code

Some Usefull commands with sequence of it

to clone repo on local device-> $git clone https://github.com/learningCodings/learningHTML.git;

If I clone git repo on my local system then it creates Folder name as repo 

After cloning repo on local system do not misbehave with .git folder it will be not work properly
.git folder stores all info related to repo like logs, comments and all other

to add file-> $git add filename;
to add multiple files at one time-> $git add .;

to give comment on it-> $git commit -m "-m is used for this message";

to upload or push code on git-> $git push;

to remove or delete or undo last comment-> $git revert;

to comment & push already added files-> $git commit -am "-am Means Add This Comment To All Files That Currently on the way to push";

to get all changes in code-> $git log;

to download or pull code from already cloned repo-> $git pull;

to test code without changing main code by creating branch-> $git checkout -b branchName;
and after it automatically switch to that new branch
And Automatically new branch became HEAD (Know More About Head May Be At Line N0: 169)
and git command impact is only on branch repo

if I want to switch my repo in between it-> $git checkout repoName;

after testing code and its working then if I want to add that Code In Main Branch then(in that branch)-> $git merge main; 

and after adding test branch code in main branch if I want to delete it then-> $git rebase;

after creating branch it is called as feature branch and main branch as master branch 
and on which branch I'm working it is called as HEAD s

to check last comment & current repo location-> $git checkout;

to check is any thing remains to push or what remains to push-> $git status;

/*Testing Git pull command what if I did not push and I'm directly pull code*/

/* 
Its Not Working first I've to push then pull then push

Some times it get complicated for me I can manage it by accepting both changes*/

It is called merge confict

it shows my changes as Head vs & remote changes as conflicting commit

It can be solved by accepting both changes or keeping only one change

GitHub Pages Using It Can Be Published Simple Static Webpages In Free Of Cost 

We Need To Just Add Extention to any repo repoName.github.io It will be considerd as github Pages And published with github account username

Python Is Interpretead Lanaguage

It Executing Program By Reading Line By Line What It Means
Then Python Program Execute Program
git
I can run Python program anywere If it installed on my system by simply using keyword-> python fileName.py; In that perticular file location
In terminal or in cmd or in powershell

Python dose not need to compile first in Binary It can direclty run Python Program

Python Supports Veriables But No Need To Specify What Is It Like Other Than int ot char
if I declaare variableit automatically recognise what is it int or str

a = 78-> int
b = 7.8-> float
c = "string"-> string
d = True -> bool
e = None -> NoneType 

In python "+" also can used to concanate string or make addition of program

And Another way to print without using + I can print it by using fromated string

Formated String-> print(f"Text,{In Currly Baracket Veriable Name}")

to take input in python-> varibaleName = input("Message: ")
This input always take input as string

if I want perform any number opration then Ive To Take Input In to number-> varibaleName = int(input("Messege: "))

Indented(empty space before line in if or else conditions) Is Required in python to understand python where is block started and where is ended

Condition Statements always follows boolen expresion 


Data Structre In Python

list-> Sequence of mutable values
it can have repeated data like names and its in order

tuple-> sequence of immutable values
it have alson order or repatable data

set-> collection of unique value
set have no order or sequence but it have only unique values
it hepls to run program effienty And it can also used while performing maths operations

dict-> collection of key-pairs
dict is dictionry and it has key-pairs value must
and it similar as our physical dictionry like words and definations 
And here Also-> word is key And defination is pair

To Add Messege While Printing Any Data Structre Use Frommated String

lists->
Python Have Built IN feature to perform operations on list Like sort, append, reverse

If I want list from user then I've to use for loop in range of how many Items I want to in list and 
first I've to declare empty list-> lst = []
to take input I've to use for loop-> for i in range(0, number):
					name = input()

and to add item in list in in for loop-> lst.append(name)

Sets->
Python Have Set Is Data Structre And It Is Follows All Rules Of Maths

And It Have Funtions Like add, remove, 
len()->To count length of set

dict->
declaration of dict-> dictName = {"Keys" : "Pair", "key1" : "Pair1"}

if I want to add extra key-pair in that-> dictName ["Key"] = "Pair"

it is ued to mapping keypair vlaues And Becomes More Powerfull in webapplications  
Loops

for loop it has by default ++ increament 

In Python if I want use numbers in sequence then I can use range() function


I can create own function by using def keyword-> 
def functionName(inputs):
	return what function dose write here

I can also access this own defined functions in aonther file also like java packages

In python functions also called as modules

to use my own functions there some several Ways-> 
from Function-fileName import *
from Function-fileName import Specific-FunctionName
import Function-fileName

function-fileName.functionName()



Python Also Support Object Oriented Programming Langauge

in it I can declare class-> class ClassName:
					def __init__(self, input, input1):
						self.x = input
						self.y = input1

and I can Access It By->
c = ClassName(inputValue, inputValue1)


In Other programming Language Object Is Must But In Python I can manupilate objects by using methodsS

__init__ must be spell right on it so many class operations depends upon __init__

otherwise it will throgh so many TypeError and exceptions it will not find fastly

Functional Programming

By Using Functional Programming I can call function and modify it throgh another function 

@functionName by using @ I can call function before declaring I'm where I want to use it

Still I'm not getting where I can Use This functional Programming


Oh I can use Fucntional Programming to define dict under list dict under dict
and like this I can use any function in any function and modify it

dict cannot comapre itself because Python dosent know which key belongs to which pair
so I need to define own function that which key should be taken to perfotm operation

or simply I can use lambda to perform sorting operation

if I want to comapre or sort operation on dict Then key and pair valume names must be same in that dict
